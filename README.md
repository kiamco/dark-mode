# Module Project: Composing Stateful Logic - Dark Mode

This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned in this module and apply them in a concrete project. This module explored Form management in React. You learned what stateful logic is, how to build custom hooks, how to compose multiple hooks together, and how to use mocks and spies in testing. In your project you will demonstrate proficiency of these subjects and principles by creating an application using each of these.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this project.**

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you and your team lead in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons.

### Description

In this project you'll take this crypto currency tracker app and build two custom hooks that, when composed together, will allow users to set and persist a dark mode preference.

## Project Set Up

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Add your team lead as collaborator on Github.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository in your terminal
- [ ] CD into the project base directory `cd dark-mode`
- [ ] Download project dependencies by running one of these two commands `yarn` or `npm install`
- [ ] Using the same command tool (yarn or npm) start up the app using `yarn start` or `npm start`
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's Repository). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [ ] Add your team lead as a reviewer on the pull-request
- [ ] Your team lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.
- [ ] Do your magic!

## Minimum Viable Product

- [ ] Build a custom hook that let's you save data to localStorage
- [ ] Build a second custom hook that sets the `dark-mode` class on the body element
- [ ] Compose your two new hooks together to be able to set and persist your user's dark mode preference in your app
<!--
- [ ] Write tests that use mocks and spies to handle dependencies in your components
